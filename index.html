      <h2>Task - The #2 Lua script obfuscator!</h2>
      <h5>By Task, Dec 28, 2023</h5>
      <p>Task is a Lua script obfuscation service. If that was completely undecipherable, let me explain.</p>
      <p>Lua is a scripting language that is commonly embedded into software to allow plugins or mods to be added without the overhead of constantly having to repackage the program. The language is easy to learn, fast, and small.</p>
      <p>Some examples of software that has used Lua are:</p>
      <p>- Adobe Lightroom: plugins to allow complex behavior in image-editing<br />- Angry Birds: levels and behaviors scripted in Lua<br />- World of Warcraft: enhancing game behavior through scriptable mods<br />- Roblox: metaverse game creation<br />- Garry's Mod: sandbox game content creation<br />- BeamNG.drive: car behavior for very realistic car physics simulation game engine<br />- X-Plane: content and behavior for realistic flight simulation<br />- Wireshark: scripting to decode obscure network traffic for interpretation by cybersecurity professionals<br />- (and more!)</p>
      <p>Lua is considered to be the leading choice in video games, and has also been used by many programs that power the internet such as Nginx, Redis, Apache, Cisco, FreeBSD, and HAProxy.</p>
      <p>However, the long standing issue of piracy and intellectual property theft applies to Lua just as much as it does to other programming languages, and even many other types of copyrighted work. The problem is even worse with scripting languages like Lua, as they are usually distributed as original source code, instead of being compiled into a binary format that omits vital information that allows humans to understand its functionality.</p>
      <p>Luraph employs various advanced techniques stemming from our virtualization software, which converts original scripts uploaded to our platform to a format only understood by the hardened Lua Virtual Machine (VM) scripts generated by the platform. With our proprietary LVM and other techniques to prevent reverse engineering, it is impossible to obtain the exact original script, and immensely difficult for attackers to extract useful data.</p>

      <h2>My mum and I did the exact same thing at the exact same time without knowing it. We live 3500km away from each other</h2>
      <h5>By Deleted User, Oct 8, 2017</h5>
      <p>So the other day I was watching this documentary on Netflix. Just as it's finishing I message my mum recommending it to her as I felt it was something she would like. She replied saying she has 4 minutes left on the show. I look down and see I have 3 minutes and 58 seconds remaining.</p>
	  <p>She lives 3500km away from me and we didn't speak before hand. We had both decided to watch the exact same documentary within 5 seconds of each other! I'm still spinning out about this.</p>
